# LIVE-DIGITAL-TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

This project presents the method to use live images feed from the cameras at traffic junctions for real time traffic density calculation using image processing. It also focuses on the algorithm for switching the traffic lights according to vehicle density on road, thereby aiming at reducing the traffic congestion on roads which will help lower the number of accidents. In turn it will provide safe transit to people and reduce fuel consumption and waiting time. It will also provide significant data which will help in future road planning and analysis. In further stages multiple traffic lights can be synchronized with each other with an aim of even less traffic congestion and free flow of traffic.
